            I'm an Architect, I graduated from the German Jordanian University, 
            I'm really excited about this course because during my studies 
            I learned so much about the user's experience in real life world and 
            I now want to learn about user's experience in the virtual world!
            </p>
            <p>
                During my work in the architectural field i gained experience in drafting 2D architectural schematics and drawings,
                creating interior and exterior design concepts for different buildings, Skilled in leveraging
                AutoCAD, Photoshop, Revit Autodesk software to create 3D architectural models, and Lumion
                for rendering 3D shots. Strong ability to coordinate and foster relationships with clients to
                promote innovative customized architectural concepts and designs.
